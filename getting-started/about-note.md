ACNN is a machine learning potential approach for atomic simulations. The original purpose was to
serve as the machine learning module for the real-space finite-difference based
large-scale KS-DFT simulation software (ARES), but it can relatively straightforward to be used
independently. 

Its main design concept is to couple multi-head self-attention
mechanism with traditional short-range machine learning potentials to improve
the accuracy of machine learning potentials, allows users to train machine
learning potential models with different levels of accuracy, including or excluding
attention mechanisms, based on their specific accuracy requirements.

ACNN primarily written in C++ and based on libtorch (C++ Distributions of PyTorch). 
Some practical utilities are placed in `scripts/`, 
and external program interfaces are placed in `interface/`.

Currently, ACNN can interface with:
- ARES-PW/MD/Phono
- LAMMPS (Including LAMMPS based packages)
- Python
- CALYPSO
- USPEX
- AIRSS

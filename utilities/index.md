Castep
------

A high performance plane wave pseudopotential total energy code. It is written and maintained by the [Castep Developers Group](http://www.castep.org/). The executable should be given the name `castep`. In other words, copy the default `castep.mpi`
or `castep.serial` that is created after compiling Castep, and rename it to `castep`. This file should be placed in your path.

OPTADOS
-------

Calculates high quality theoretical DOS, Projected-DOS, Joint-DOS, Optics and core-loss spectroscopy.

http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~ajm255/optados/index.html

Gulp (optional)
---------------

Structure prediction may be performed using a variety of empirical force fields, as implemented in Julian Gale's powerful Gulp code.

http://gulp.curtin.edu.au/gulp/

LAMMPS (optional, not currently recommended)
--------------------------------------------

Structural optimisation is not currently sufficiently stable in this MD focussed code.

http://lammps.sandia.gov/

pspot
-----

This is a directory containing the default Castep `xx_00PBE.usp(cc)` pseudopotentials. In more recent versions of Castep the QC5 set of high-throughput potentials provide an alternative. These can be used for general searching, but tailored OTFG potentials are recommended for accurate results, and/or very high pressures. It is assumed that pspot is in your home directory. If not, set `PSPOT_DIR` appropriately. 

qhull
-----

Calculates the convex hulls.

http://www.qhull.org/

hull (optional)
---------------

Ken Clarkson's convex hull code.

http://www.netlib.org/voronoi/hull.html

antiprism (optional)
---------

http://www.antiprism.com/files/antiprism-0.24.1.tar.gz

R/Rscript
---------

The statistical package R is used to visualise ternary convex hulls. The `ternary.r` scripts can be executed using `Rscript`. The `ggtern` packaged is required.

https://cran.r-project.org/
http://www.ggtern.com/

xmgrace
-------

http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/

Xmgrace/Grace is useful for visualising results. `.agr` scripts are generated to facilitate this.

cif2cell
--------

This handy python utility can convert from cif files to a variety of electronic structure codes, including Castep.

http://cif2cell.sourceforge.net/

Core AIRSS Scripts and Codes
============================

airss.pl
--------

This Perl script performs ab initio random structure searching. See [AIRSS Examples](../examples) for instruction in its use. Random structures are repeatedly generated by `buildcell`, and relaxed with the chosen code (the default is Castep).

buildcell
---------

This fortan code reads annotated Castep `.cell` files, and generates random "sensible" structures from them. The type of randomness introduced can be controlled through hash-tagged directives (which are treated as comments and ignored by Castep).

cabal
-----

A structure conversion tool. Usage:

```console
$ cabal in out < seed.in > seed.out

in==out : Niggli reduce
supports castep+,cell,shx,res,gulp*,cif*,psi4*,xtl,xyz(e)
*output only +input only
```

The following converts a castep cell file to a SHELX `.res` (results) file.

```console
$ cabal cell res < input.cell > output.res
```

ca
--

A bash wrapper for cryan (see below). Uses the same command line options as cryan.

cryan
-----

A general purpose fortran program to analyse large amounts of structure data. The structures are read from STDIN, for example:

```console
$ cat *.res | cryan -s
$ gunzip -c lots.res.gz | cryan -f H2O -r
$ find . -name "*.res" | xargs cat | cryan -m
$ cat H2O-P21c.res | cryan -g
```

Experience suggests that cryan is suitable for the analysis of up to about 100K structures. Other techniques are required for larger data sets.

castep_relax
------------

This bash script performs a self consistent geometry optimisation of the specified structure using Castep.

vasp_relax
----------

This bash script performs a self consistent geometry optimisation of the specified structure using VASP.

gulp_relax
-----------

This bash script performs a geometry optimisation of the specified structure using gulp.

pp3_relax
----------

This bash script performs a geometry optimisation of the specified structure using pp3, a very simple pair potential code.

lammps_relax
------------

This bash script performs a geometry optimisation of the specified structure using lammps.

> **Note:** This package is not currently recommended due to issues with structural optimisation.

psi4_relax
------------

This bash script performs a geometry optimisation of the
specified structure using psi4.

> **Note:** This package is not currently recommended due to issues with structural optimisation.

gencell
-------

This bash script will generate a set of recommended Castep `.cell` and `.param` files from a supplied unit cell volume, and atoms contained in the cell. It is strongly recommended that this is used as a starting point for most projects.

pp3
---

A simple pair potential code, for testing. It is used in the early chapters of the examples.

run.pl
------

This perl script runs a batch of castep jobs in a directory. It is useful for "polishing" your results, and high-throughput computation in general. Failed runs are placed into 'bad_castep'.

crud.pl
-------

The Castep run daemon. A perl script for high-throughput batch calculations. The structures to be relaxed are placed in the 'hopper' directory (`/hopper`). Successful calculations are placed in `/good_castep`, and those that fail are placed into `bad_castep`. The script can be run as a daemon (i.e. continues running once the hopper is empty, and waits for more).

spawn
-----

This script can be used to submit multiple jobs to the selection of machines listed in the `~/.spawn` file. For example:

```
node1 slots=8 root=
node2 slots=8 root=
node3 slots=12 root=
```

Typing `spawn airss.pl -seed Carbon` on your root node (on which it is not advisable to run large jobs) will start a total of 28 instances of airss.pl using the `Carbon.*` input files, on your 3 remote nodes. Spawn uses ssh to run the commands remotely. Password-free access to the resources in your `.spawn` file is convenient.

The alternative to `spawn` or `mpirun` is to use the queueing system of a multiuser computer cluster to submit multiple jobs. This should be discussed with your system administrators.

spawn-slow
----------

Similar to the spawn script, this more slowly requests remote jobs. This is recommended when launching the `run.pl` and `crud.pl` scripts.

despawn
-------

The spawn scripts records the PIDs of the remotely spawned jobs. This script can be used to halt calculations in a controlled manner.

stopairss
---------

A script to kill spawned jobs. It will kill all jobs owned by you on the remote nodes—so use with care. Use `despawn` in preference.

symm
----

Finds the space group of the structure.

tidy.pl
-------

Removes the output of uncompleted calculations.

niggli
------

Performs a Niggli transformation on all the SHELX `.res` files in the current directory.

prim
----

Converts all the SHELX `.res` files in the current directory to primitive cells.

conv
----

Converts all the SHELX `.res` files in the current directory to conventional cells.
